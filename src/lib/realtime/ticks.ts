// Realtime tick ingestion.
//
// The problem this solves: a market data feed pushes far more messages than the
// screen can show. Writing each message straight into reactive state means the
// framework does 10,000 updates to paint 60 frames, and the tab stalls. The fix
// is two-stage — coalesce raw messages into a per-key buffer (cheap, no reactive
// writes), then drain a bounded slice of that buffer once per animation frame.
//
// Consequences worth knowing:
//   - Per key, only the LATEST state is ever applied. Intermediate ticks are
//     collapsed, which is what you want for a price board and what you do NOT
//     want for a trade tape (append those directly, or key them uniquely).
//   - `cap` bounds the work per frame, so a burst cannot blow the frame budget.
//     A sustained overload shows up as a growing `pending` depth rather than as
//     dropped frames — surface it if your feed can outrun the screen.
//
// Nothing here is Svelte-specific or DOM-specific: the scheduler is injectable,
// which is also how it is unit-tested without a browser.
